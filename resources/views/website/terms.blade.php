                online healthcare platform for healthcare service providers to manage their day to day operations and

            <p>The YoPractice supports the goal of electronic patient records management for health by providing
                healthcare service providers who are our Clients, with a solution (involving Patient record management
                and electronic claims management and hereafter collectively referred to as the ‘Client-Site’) that
                enables them to be securely accessible to their patients, through web and mobile services enabling SAAS
                and on-premise setup and real-time claim processing. The Client-Site applications are intended only as
                tools, which help healthcare providers and their patients to collaborate in the healthcare of the
                patients, using communication, scheduling, administrative and data managing capabilities. This enables
                online presence management for better patient records management.</p>
            <p>If you do not agree to these Terms of Use and/or are not eligible or authorized to agree to these Terms

                Client-Site.</p>
            <p>You are not impersonating any other person and are using your actual identity.</p>
            <p>The information provided during the registration process is true, accurate, current and complete. You
                will be required to provide your full name, email address, mobile phone number, location, business name
