                <li>Virtual Practice Account Info: Information that the Customer provides to Webstudio at the time of
                    setting up their Virtual Practice account. This also includes information required for subscription

                    method information.

                    be captured in logs. These mechanisms are used to help diagnose issues and preferences which help us

                    non-personally identifiable information related to your online service usage as part of supporting
                    platform services.

                    within their Virtual Practice. This is optional and entirely upto the Customer. For instance the

                    services rendered to Patient users through the Virtual Practice. In this case the Customer is
                    authorizing the YoPractice Platform services to receive certain configuration and operational
                    information relevant to the integration with the third party service. Customers should check the

                    channels.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Note: With regard to the definition of data controller and data processor, as defined by Data Protection
                laws in the EU, the Customer is the data controller of Customer Data and Webstudio is the data
                processor. Webstudio is the data controller of Other Data, as defined above.</p> <h4>Use of
                Information</h4> <h6>Customer Data</h6>
            <p>The Customer is the owner and controller of the Customer Data, which is processed by Webstudio as per
                the configuration settings and instructions of the Customer. The Customer alone decides which Authorized
                Users to create and terminate; and what access such Authorized Users have to add, update, delete, export
                or share the data. The Customer defines the policies, practices and usage terms for Authorized Users of
                the Virtual Practice and it is the sole responsibility of the Customer to enforce that. A Customer can
                terminate Authorized Patient User accounts at any time and such Patients will no longer have further
                access to their personal health information in event of that happening. Whether or not to share that
                information with the Patient User before termination of the Patient User account is the prerogative of
                the Customer only.</p> <h6>Other Data</h6>

            <h4>Disclosure of Information</h4>
            <p>We may disclose any information to government or law enforcement officials if we believe doing so is

                Data only as per the request and instructions of the Customer, whether as defined in terms of the
                service configuration that they apply in use of the Virtual Practice or by direct requests. Disclosure

                Practice, should check the privacy policy and settings of such services and should understand what data
                may be shared between such authorized services and Webstudio, relevant to the integrated functioning
                expected.</p>
            <p>If Webstudio becomes involved in a merger, acquisition, or any form of sale of some or all of its
                assets, Other Information will be transferred to the new entity for the continued performance of
                service, subject to standard confidentiality agreements.</p> <h4>Data Retention</h4>

                deactivated their account if it is required to comply with legal obligations, for audits and for
                legitimate business needs.</p> <h4 id="cookiePolicy">Cookie Policy</h4>

                you cannot use the service features to do this, please contact our support desk for help. In the case of
                Authorized Users of a Customer Virtual Practice, it is important to directly contact the Customer for
                such support including objection to processing of your data, as the Customer is the data controller of
                Customer Data. Based on its legitimate interests and compliance requirements, Webstudio may process
                Other Data that includes user data for legitimate purposes.</p> <h4>Links to Other Websites</h4>
